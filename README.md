# IPyDashboards

The following repo contains a collection of walk-throughs, kitchen-sinks and examples (of varying complexity) that cover most of the usual suspects when constructing dashboards within ipython/jupyter notebooks.  


## Contents  

The contents of these repo is subdivided into static dashboards and dynamic dashboards:

* **Static dashboards** are normal run-of-the-mill dashboards that allow the user to interact with data or processes within a certain set of pre-delimited rules and possibilities.  

* **Dynamic dashboards** are dashboards that react and adapt to the user's inputs are changes in the data. New widgets may appear/dissapear, groups may become hidden or visible and options might change along with changes in the data or other values of the dashboard themselves. Although these dashboards are fancier and allow for a bigger amount of customization and flexibility, not all dashboards need be dynamic.
